GENERAL PROVISIONS

11. A "U.S. Government End User" shall mean any agency or entity of the 
government of the United States. The following shall apply if Licensee 
is a U.S. Government End User. The Licensed Software is a "commercial 
item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), 
consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer 
software documentation," as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 
(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 
through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire 
the Licensed Software with only those rights set forth herein. The 
Licensed Software (including related documentation) is provided to U.S. 
Government End Users: (a) only as a commercial end item; and (b) only 
pursuant to this Agreement.

12. This Agreement may only be modified in writing signed by authorized 
representatives of Licensee and ICS. In case of a conflict between the 
Agreement and the terms of any purchase order or other ordering 
document, the Agreement shall prevail. If any provision of the Agreement 
is found void or unenforceable, the remainder will remain valid and 
enforceable according to its terms. If any remedy provided is determined 
to have failed for its essential purpose, all limitations of liability 
and exclusions of damages set forth in this Agreement shall remain in 
effect.

13. This Agreement shall be construed, interpreted and governed by the 
laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, USA. Any action or proceeding 
arising from or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the 
Federal Courts sitting in Boston, Massachusetts or in the State Court in 
Middlesex County, Massachusetts, and each party irrevocably submits to 
the personal jurisdiction of any such court in any such action or 
proceeding. The Agreement gives Licensee specific legal rights; Licensee 
may have others, which vary from state to state and from country to 
country. ICS reserves all rights not specifically granted in this 
Agreement.
