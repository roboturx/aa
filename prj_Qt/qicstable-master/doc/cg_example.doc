\page cg_example Example - Creating a Table with a Custom Grid

This example shows how to create a custom table grid object, and also
shows how to create a table that uses this new grid.  The grid acts
like the default QicsTableGrid, except that it posts a popup menu
when the user presses the right mouse button.

The code in this example can be found in \b \<QICSDIR\>/examples/custom_grid.

For more information about creating a custom grid, see
\ref keymouse_behavior.
