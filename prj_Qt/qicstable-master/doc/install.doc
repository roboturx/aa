/*! \page install Installation

\b Note:  You may need to be logged in as root, depending on the permissions of
the directories where you choose to install %QicsTable.

This product is built with, and depends on, Qt version 4.2 and newer.
You must have Qt installed on the machine that you are using to build
this product.

In the following instructions, \b \<QICSTABLE\> refers to the toplevel
directory of the %QicsTable distribution.  For example, if you
unpacked the Linux/Unix archive in \c /opt, \b \<QICSTABLE\> would refer to 
<tt>/opt/qicstable-x.x.x-unix-commercial-source</tt>

In the case of binding QicsTable to KDChart, please note that only KDChart 2.x 
is supported; any previous versions would not work. \b \<KDCHART\> refers to the
toplevel directory of the KDChart distribution.

-  Unpack the archive.
    - <b>On Linux/Unix:</b>  <tt>'tar xzvf qicstable-x.x.x-unix-commercial-source.tar.gz</tt>
      or, if your \c tar command doesn't support the '-z' flag,
      <tt>'gunzip -c qicstable-x.x.x-unix-commercial-source.tar.gz | tar xvf -'</tt>
    - <b>On Windows:</b>  Unzip <tt>qicstable-x.x.x-win32-commercial-source.zip</tt> using WinZip
	          or similar utility.  Be sure to extract the
	          entire folder hierarchy.

-  By default, %QicsTable will build with the following options:
     - 'release' build
     - shared library/DLL

     If you wish to change any of these options, edit the configuration
     file \c \<QICSTABLE\>/qicstable_config.pri.  Each option is documented in
     the configuration file.

-  If you would like to enable KDChart support, do the following:
     - Install KDChart 2.x to a directory on the filesystem (see KDChart
        documentation for details). <KDCHART> would point to the root
        of the installation.
     - Go to <QICSTABLE>/qicstable_config.pri file and find a line 
        <tt>#KDCHART_PATH =</tt>
     - Uncomment this line and write here the value of <KDCHART>.
         - For example, if KDChart has been installed into /opt/kdchart-2.0
           then the given line should look like:
            <tt>KDCHART_PATH = /opt/kdchart-2.0</tt>

-  Set the environment variable <b>QTDIR</b> to the location of your
    Qt distribution.  If you  are using the built-in Qt distribution
    on most Linux platforms, this location is \b /usr/local/Trolltech/Qt-<QtVersion>.  If you
    have built Qt yourself from the source distribtion, use the
    location of that build.

    - If you are using 'csh' as your shell, you can set QTDIR as
      follows:  <tt>setenv QTDIR <your_qt_location></tt>.

    - If you are using 'bash' or 'ksh' as your shell, you can set
      QTDIR as follows:  <tt>QTDIR=<your_qt_location>; export QTDIR</tt>

    - If you are using the Windows command shell, you can set QTDIR as
      follows:  <tt>'set QTDIR=<your_qt_location></tt>

-  Build the distribution using the Qt utility 'qmake'.
   - <b>On Linux/Unix/Windows:</b>
      - Change directory to \B \<QICSTABLE\> and execute the following command:
        <tt>qmake qicstable.pro</tt>

-  Once the toplevel makefile is built, you may build the distribution.
   - <b>On Linux/Unix:</b> \c make or \c gmake
   - <b>On Windows(MSVC):</b> \c nmake

    This will build the %QicsTable library and all the examples.

-  HTML documentation can be found in \c \<QICSTABLE\>/doc/html.  The
    main page is \c index.html

-  Examples can be found in \c \<QICSTABLE\>/examples.

-  On Windows, you will need to modify your Path environment variable
   in order for the example programs to find the QicsTable DLL.  This
   can be done in a number of different ways, depending on the
   version of Windows that you are running.  One way that will always
   work is via the command line.

   <tt>C:>  set Path=<QICSTABLE>;%%Path%</tt>

   As before, replace <QICSTABLE> with the full path to the directory
   in which you unpacked the archive.
