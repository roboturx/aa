\page how_span HOWTO - Cell Spanning

The QicsTable widget supports cell spanning.  Cell spanning is a way
of specifying a region of the grid that should appear as one cell. The
contents of the first (top and left) cell in the span is displayed in
the entire spanned region.

When a cell span is created, all of the cells that are \a spanned
(i.e. cells that are in the spanning region but are not the first cell
in the region) are not visible.  They cannot be traversed to, and thus
cannot be edited.  If you are trying to cause a cell to display its
contents over multiple cells, but still want those cells to be able to
be edited, you should investigate cell overflow features instead (see
\ref how_overflow for details).

A cell spanning region is specified by a QicsSpan object.  A QicsSpan
object differs from a QicsRegion object in that a span is specified by
a starting cell and a height and width, while a region is specified by
a start cell and an end cell.

Once you have created a span object, simply add the span by calling
\link QicsTable::addCellSpan addCellSpan()\endlink.  This method will
check to make sure that this new span does not overlap any other span.

\code
    // Create a span starting at cell (1,1), spanning 2 rows and 3 columns
    QicsSpan span(1,1, 2,3);

    // Add the span to the table
    table->addCellSpan(span);

    // Set a new value in the starting cell of the span
    QString val = QString("Span region from cell (1,1)\n2 rows x 3 columns");
    data_model->setItem(1, 1, val);
\endcode

To remove a span, call
\link QicsTable::removeCellSpan removeCellSpan()\endlink.  Because no
two cell spans can overlap, it is only necessary to specify the
starting cell of the span to remove it.

The current list of spanned regions in the table can be retrieved by
calling
\link QicsTable::cellSpanList cellSpanList()\endlink.  The returned
list is a \b copy of the table's internal list, and must be deleted by
the caller when it is no longer needed.  Modifications to this list
will not affect the table.

One specialized use of cell spanning is to create major/minor rows and
columns.  Please see \ref how_major for details.
