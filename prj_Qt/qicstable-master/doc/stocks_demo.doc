This demonstration program shows QicsTable used in a simple stock market 
simulation.  In the source, you will find examples of setting
properties on cells, rows, and columns.  Frozen rows are used, and
real-time updates are shown.

The code in this example can be found in \b \<QICSDIR\>/examples/stocks.
