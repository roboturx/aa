\page freeze_example Example - Freezing Rows and Columns

This example shows how one can freeze rows and columns in a QicsTable
widget.  The \b View menu contains a dialog that allows the user
to pop up dialogs to move selected rows and/or columns to the edges of
the table, as well as a dialog that allows the user to freeze rows and
columns.

The code in this example can be found in \b \<QICSDIR\>/examples/frozen.

For more information about freezing rows and columns, see \ref how_freeze.
