This directory contains documentation for QIcsTable 
and a documentation index file 'QicsTable.dcf'.

Note: If you do not see .dcf or .html files,
that means you are using a CVS checked out copy, and must 
generate them using ../bin/generate_docs

QicsTable.dcf - index file which contain non global (relative to his path) links to 
documentation *.html files in 'html' dirrectory.
NOTE: File "QicsTable.dcf" and folder "html" should be in the same folder when they where copied.

From Qt documentation :
    Documentation can be added or removed from Qt Assistant by adding and removing the 
content files. The format of the content files are specified below. To add a content file, 
type the following command line option: -addContentFile docfile. To remove a content file 
from the default set, type the following command line option: -removeContentFile 'docfile'. 

For example:
    1: > assistant -addContentFile QicsTable.dcf
    2: > assistant
    3: > assistant -removeContentFile QicsTable.dcf

Note: In Qt 4.4, assistant was re-designed, 
so you must use assistant_adp to import .dcf files.

documentation set.
