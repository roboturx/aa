\page how_overflow HOWTO - Cell Overflowing

%QicsTable has a number of ways to handle a cell that cannot display
all of its data in the cell's normal area.  One way is cell spanning,
which allows a larger region of the table to always appear as one
cell (see \ref how_span for details).  Cell spanning is very powerful,
but has the sometimes undesirable effect of making any spanned cells
invisible and uneditable.

Another, less intrusive way of displaying cell data that cannot fit
into the cell's normal area is by setting the table's
\link QicsTable::cellOverflowBehavior "cellOverflowBehavior"\endlink
property.  (This property is actually a common grid property, so you
can set it on not only the table's main grid, but its row and column
headers as well.)  The table supports three types of overflow
behavior.

The default overflow behavior is \b Clip.  In this case, the text of
the cell is displayed according to the current setting of the
\link QicsTable::gridCellClipping "gridCellClipping"\endlink
property.  The text will either be partially displayed
(<B>AllowPartial</B>), not displayed at all
(<B>NoDisplayOnPartial</B>), or partially displayed with a "clipped"
symbol (<B>UseClippedSymbol</B>).  In the last instance, the clipped
symbol can be changed by setting the
\link QicsTable::moreTextPixmap "moreTextPixmap"\endlink property.

The second overflow behavior is \b Overflow.  In this case, the table
will attempt to "overflow" the additional text to the next cell(s) to
the right.  When the table performs an overflow, it looks for the next
cell to the right of the original cell.  If that cell is empty, its
area is added to the original cell's area to create a larger "cell".
If this new area is large enough to display the entire text, the
overflow is complete.  If it still is not large enough, the table will
continue by looking at the next cell to the right.  This iteration
continues until one of the following occurs:  (1) the entire text can
be displayed, (2) the next cell is not empty, (3) the right edge of
the table is reached, or (4) the number of overflowed cells exceeds
the current value of the
\link QicsTable::maxOverflowCells "maxOverflowCells"\endlink
property.  If, at the end of this iteration, the entire text is still
not visible, the full text is displayed according to the
\link QicsTable::gridCellClipping "gridCellClipping"\endlink
property in as many cells as possible.

When an empty cell is overflowed into, it is still able to be
traversed to and edited.  When the empty cell becomes the current
cell, the overflow is removed.  When the empty cell is no longer the
current cell (i.e. the user traversed to another cell), the overflow
appears again.

The third overflow behavior is \b Tooltip.  In this case, the extra
text is clipped as in the \b Clip behavior, but when the user hovers
the mouse pointer over the cell, the entire contents of the cell is
displayed in a tooltip.
