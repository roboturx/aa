               PyQicsTable - Python Bindings for the QicsTable Widget


INTRODUCTION

These are the Python bindings for the QicsTable widget.  You must also have
PyQt and the SIP Python bindings generator installed.

The homepage of PyQt is http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/.

The homepage of SIP is http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/sip/.

NOTE: for building PyQicsTable for Qt 4.5.x you should have SIP 4.8 or later.

INSTALLATION

Check for any other README files in this directory that relate to your
particular platform.  Feel free to contribute a README for your platform or to
provide updates to any existing documentation.

The first step is to configure PyQicsTable by running the following command.

	python configure.py

This assumes that the correct Python interpreter is on your path.  Something
like the following may be appropriate on Windows.

	c:\python23\python configure.py

If you have multiple versions of Python installed then make sure you use the
interpreter for which you wish to generate bindings for.

The configure.py script takes many options.  Use the "-h" command line option
to display a full list of the available options.

The next step is to build PyQicsTable using your platform's make command.

	make

Optionaly you can add CFLAGS and/or CXXFLAGS(CPPFLAGS) for make utility 
(e.g. nonstandard header directory, optimization code features ...).

The final step is to install PyQicsTable by running the following command.
(Depending on your system you may require root or administrator privileges.)

	make install


THE REST OF THE DISTRIBUTION

The "examples" directory contain ports to Python of the QicsTable example
applications.

The "doc" directory contains SGML and HTML documentation for the bindings.
This documentation includes a section describing the differences visible to
the Python programmer between this and the previous version - please read it.
