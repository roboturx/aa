# QicsTable: High Performance Table Widget

## Description

QicsTable is a full-featured, high-performance table widget suited for use in industrial-strength applications. It incorporates a model-view-controller architecture, so that multiple table widgets can display the same data. The QicsTable widget has extensive printing capabilities, including the ability to print the table with different visual characteristics than the on-screen table display.

QicsTable requires Qt version 4.7.0 or newer, including Qt 5. The code and all of the demos and examples are known to build and run under Ubuntu Linux and Qt versions up to and including Qt 5.13.2.
