This is QicsTable, version 3.0.0

QicsTable is a full-featured, high-performance table widget suited for
use in industrial-strength applications.  It incorporates a
model-view-controller architecture, so that multiple table widgets can
display the same data.  The QicsTable widget has extensive printing
capabilities, including the ability to print the table with different
visual characteristics than the on-screen table display.

QicsTable requires Qt version 4.7.0 or newer.

The code has also been ported to Qt 5, but has not been fully tested.
The code and all of the demos and examples are known to build and run
under Ubuntu Linux and Qt versions up to and including Qt 5.15.2.
