This is QicsTable kdchart support demo.

To enable KDChart support, you should make QicsTable library
with KDChart enabled (see <QICSTABLE>/INSTALL for detailed instructions):

  a. Install KDChart 2.1+ to a directory on the filesystem (see KDChart
     documentation for details). <KDCHART> would point to the root
     of the installation.

  b. Go to <QICSTABLE>/qicstable_config.pri file and find a line 

     #KDCHART_PATH =

     Uncomment this line and write here the value of <KDCHART>.
     For example, if KDChart has been installed into /opt/kdchart-2.1
     then the given line should look like:

     KDCHART_PATH = /opt/kdchart-2.1

     That's all - KDChart support enabled. Save the file and follow the 
     instructions of <QICSTABLE>/INSTALL.
